# Hot or Cold
Hot or Cold is a simple game made by React and Redux, in which, the user has to guess the number between 1-100.
Each feedbacks give a clue to the user based on the differences between the guess and the actual random number.
The game is a mix of a lot of luck and a small of problem solving skill.
